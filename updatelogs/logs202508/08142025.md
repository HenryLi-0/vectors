# 8/14/2025 - 9th Update!

ok, 4:13 PM, back to cad!

yeah so after like 15 minutes i fell aslepp for 2.25 hrs. anyways, ground intake keeps getting more weird, probably gonna make the rollers very simple (as in, without the inner wheels) to make it have less traignles (and at the end of the day, the triangles inside the wheels dont really help with anything anyways since we're not simulating the wheel compression physics!)

mfw each set of rollers contain 2830 triangles (now the entire model is 19918 triangles)

ok 2476 triangles now, reduced some!

in order to save time, i think im gonna leave a couple things out, considering the motors on the intake and the intake gearbox, but idk. however, for the belt system in the ground intake (you know, the one that aligns the coral to the middle), i think im just gonna make the rollers and leave it at that. was planning on modelling belts and chains, but at this point, we're spending way too long on this cad. (and in the grand scheme of things, adding some stuff is really just for appearance since it doesnt exactly affected the coral path)

ok, 7:46 PM now, added the ground intake rollers! this means, in theory, we should be ready to move on to implementing this! so uh, noticed an issue with the ground intake middle rollers being a bit funny (no bearings, hex shaft looks wonky), but should be fine? idk, more of an aesthetic thing!

so yeah! 19962 triangles! (oops forgot to add the diagonal elevator support thing, but eh)

ok im off to dinner

so uh last commit and the one before that kinda got sqished into one commit, i guess force pushing was a bad idea, but whoops

ok, back at 9:24 PM after a bit, gonna think about structure?

so i use a hinge joint or something to constrain movement? idk. anyways, exporting time!

ok, just checking that things theoretically align in onshape, and they do! seems like the transfer from ground intake to arm works! ok, actually exporting now! some time later, everything's prepared it their own assemblies! this *should* (in theory) make aligning things in godot simplier, so time to export i guess!

mfw

yeah, lots of unzipping to do

wow everything compressed is 188 KB (robonauts reference???) anyways, uncompressed is sitting at 581 KB, which is pretty good!

ok, updated the license!

ok, and everything's pushed! time to open up godot...

so uh 10:50 PM now, and ive noticed something funny, godot seems to "forget" some regions for some reason. idk why.

![huh](</updatelogs/images/202508/08142025 - 3.png>)

yeah, so i can see somethings from one side only. for some reason. imma go watch a movie, idk how to solve this one! yeah, gonna be right back

ok, 11:44 PM, so i think that we should just uh... import this into blender and export it as a glb. 

this process takes a lot longer than i thought it would.

yeah, 12:12 AM now, and everything is a `.glb` file now! seems like all the colors got applied properly! ok, back to godot...

yeah so it turns out i exported the drivetrain uncentered oops, ok fixed!

positioned all the subsystems, now just need to add their rollers

arm rollers in, time for the ground intake!

and there it is! 12:53 AM, and the robot's inside godot! im gonna quickly restructure the elevator so that they actually, you know, move together!

![woo](</updatelogs/images/202508/08142025 - 4.png>)

yeah i know i still have to add collision boxes

ok, added *some* collision boxes for the *simplier* stuff, but not sure if i should do 4 collision boxes for the box tubing of the first stage of the elevator, or just do one big rectangle. basically, all rollers are good, just the complex shaped plates arent done yet

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202508/08142025 - 5.png>)

waw

anyways, yeah, started modifying the script for driving, but it seems that it became really goofy (flying robots, weird units), moved the center of mass down, but yeah, its still pretty confused! i guess its probably just better to start fresh for the drive script! but yeah, that's it for today! good night!
