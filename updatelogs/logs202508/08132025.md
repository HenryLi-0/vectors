# 8/13/2025 - 8th Update!

ok, so today was quite a day, internet was kinda gone for a big part, turns out it also started raining and something about an internet plan or something, but basically, nothing happened, internet's back, and we'll probably have to deal with it another day. anyways, currently wet and rainy at 9:58 PM

now, as i say this, the internet has once again choosen to break itself, so let me fix this before i start cadding again

ok its back and im not back, in fact, im gonna go

(this goes against a lot of what i envision how cad should be done, this is NOT easily readable nor easily understandable. and its also very unorganized. unfortauntely, cant seem to figure out how this works/have the mental capacity right now to do it)

mfw i realize i had to CAD the whole coral aligning thing on the ground intake
