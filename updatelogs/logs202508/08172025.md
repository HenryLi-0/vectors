# 8/17/2025 - 11th Update!

yeah, 3:01 PM today! so, what happened yesterday? idk, kinda just felt really tired and not too motivated to really work on *anything* yesterday, so just took the day off to rest and do pratcice some art. but yeah, back today! anyways, since i get to make you read anything, im now on comic 275 of housepets, currently reading 100 pages a day lol

anyways, back to code! got lots of goofy issues to fix today!

*i wanna go back to sleep aaa*

ive been punching random numbers and vector3 math stuff everywhere and sometings happening but also not happening

OFNASODNFASLDNBGVOUSDNV ASDASFASDFA

I THINK I JUST GOT A REVELATION! AN IDEA! A POTENTIAL CAUSE FOR THIS MISERY!

nope lol

now hold on a second i think i found something

wait wait wait getting the global transform and rotating local or something

still not able to figure out how to get the rotation yet though, nvm arm still not rotating super properly

why is this so hard, maybe i should go back to khan academy and finish learning linear algebra

im at the verge of my wits

huh that worked, just freaks out when you make it move while driving

hmm things are *kinda* working, im gonna try to see if inputting the correct masses make it work better

horrible idea

ok, so i made a solution. ready? just manually locking the axis since godot is very silly i guess. the locks dont have any local ones, so im think we just have a main physics process that pings each subsystem to do its physics in order, so that we dont have conflicts. anyways, that took a whole 2 days to just have a jank "if it works it works" solution, but thats alright, i cant really afford more time on this. (we are, in fact, 2 days behind schedule)

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202508/08172025 - 1.png>)

gonna commit now, kinda getting tired

oh yeah i also added the correct masses back, seems like its ok with manual locking

anyways, back again (left at 6:15 PM, back at 6:33 PM!), this time working on the scripts!

mfw pid controller, anyways, wrote some theoretical stuff for the end roller. the idea behind what im currently doing is like a command way so that it keeps going at it and you can tell it to stop. or in other words, you set the goal/stuff to do, and it tries to do that everytime the `do_physics()` is called. this *should* allow us to control the sequence of control, which i suspect is the issue behind our current system (when things go funny when drive goes funny). anyways, all that will be in some main physics process, probably under commands

ok 7:00 PM and im off again to dinner this time (also cant seem to figure out how to call functions form other stuff? like it should work right? or am i thinking of it wrong...)

returned at 7:51 PM and i think my mouse is probably a biohazard. ill clean it someday.

ok, structure seems to work ok, im gonna edit the field collision real quick to have the reefs

keep having the issue of the robot phasing through the field walls when going too fast lol, hmm seems to only happen when the robot is at an angle?

wait i need to drop in some coral... how do i make a cylinder with a negative slice in the center (aka, a hole)

so coral currently have a big issue, they kinda go up and down in the ground and if you push them too hard, they sorta phase through the walls. besides that, figured out how to do the method stuff (it just doesnt show up, you just gotta hope. and i also spelled physics wrong whoops) but yeah!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202508/08172025 - 2.png>)

coral! anyways, havent tested if intake works yet, still have to create that collision box... anyways imma watch a movie (9:15 PM now, earlier than usual!) ok, see ya! oh yeah, heres a commit.
