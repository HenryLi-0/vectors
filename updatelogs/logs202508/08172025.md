# 8/17/2025 - 11th Update!

yeah, 3:01 PM today! so, what happened yesterday? idk, kinda just felt really tired and not too motivated to really work on *anything* yesterday, so just took the day off to rest and do pratcice some art. but yeah, back today! anyways, since i get to make you read anything, im now on comic 275 of housepets, currently reading 100 pages a day lol

anyways, back to code! got lots of goofy issues to fix today!

*i wanna go back to sleep aaa*

ive been punching random numbers and vector3 math stuff everywhere and sometings happening but also not happening

I THINK I JUST GOT A REVELATION! AN IDEA! A POTENTIAL CAUSE FOR THIS MISERY!

nope lol

now hold on a second i think i found something

wait wait wait getting the global transform and rotating local or something

still not able to figure out how to get the rotation yet though, nvm arm still not rotating super properly

why is this so hard, maybe i should go back to khan academy and finish learning linear algebra

im at the verge of my wits

huh that worked, just freaks out when you make it move while driving

hmm things are *kinda* working, im gonna try to see if inputting the correct masses make it work better

horrible idea

ok, so i made a solution. ready? just manually locking the axis since godot is very silly i guess. the locks dont have any local ones, so im think we just have a main physics process that pings each subsystem to do its physics in order, so that we dont have conflicts. anyways, that took a whole 2 days to just have a jank "if it works it works" solution, but thats alright, i cant really afford more time on this. (we are, in fact, 2 days behind schedule)

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202508/08172025 - 1.png>)

gonna commit now, kinda getting tired
