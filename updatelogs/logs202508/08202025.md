# 8/20/2025 - 14th Update!

looked at the docs, trying new things, also, trying out `HingeJoint3D` incase it does something

hmm, just watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JP_bEm4xvE) video on 2d joints, hopefully it applies?

hmm not seeming to work? tried switching physics engines, seems to work except every subsystem just gets detached from the drivetrain

switched it to a `PinJoint3D`, and it seems to so some self correcting, so i guess it does work?

WAIT I THINK THIS IS IT!

ok, so that's working! what doesnt seem to be working is the ground intake rotation, however. imma quickly push though!

yeah so its just possesed or something. gonna watch a movie now (10:34 PM)

back at 11:48 PM! 

ok, reverted the hinge stuff for the ground intake (the plates, not the rollers) and it seems to no longer be possesed and leave the elevator floating. ok, now, time to figure out how to fix the ground intake

i have an idea, which is to move everything out of their "shells" to be together, not sure if that'll fix the issue, but it would be really bad if it goes wrong, so heres another commit!
