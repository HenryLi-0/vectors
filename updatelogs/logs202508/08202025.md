# 8/20/2025 - 14th Update!

looked at the docs, trying new things, also, trying out `HingeJoint3D` incase it does something

hmm, just watched [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2JP_bEm4xvE) video on 2d joints, hopefully it applies?

hmm not seeming to work? tried switching physics engines, seems to work except every subsystem just gets detached from the drivetrain

switched it to a `PinJoint3D`, and it seems to so some self correcting, so i guess it does work?

WAIT I THINK THIS IS IT!

ok, so that's working! what doesnt seem to be working is the ground intake rotation, however. imma quickly push though!
