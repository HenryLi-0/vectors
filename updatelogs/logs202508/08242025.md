# 8/24/2025 - 18th Update!

back at it again! currently 6:05 PM in nyc!

ok, testing the elevator positions right now, i dont exactly think the elevator should be flying off right now? turns out, the arm position is nicely half a rotation off, so thats a faster fix!

hmm, divided the height by 1.5, seems to make the number work better now? probably because of our cursed elevator double pid setup, but yeah, L4 seems realistic for the positions and such!

ok, so before i was planning on a giant `if elif else` statement to do all the state logic and setting stuff, but turns out yesterday i had a nice idea called "have a dictionary that has all the states and stuff so the code looks better", so gotta clean up what i just wrote oops

ok, the `STATE_POSITIONS` is pretty much ready to be implemented! each state just has a list of 5 things that describe the state of the ground intake raised, ground intake roller direction, the elevator position, the arm position, and the arm roller directions! of course, these are in their "respective" units, just cleaner to convert them in the other script than here! should also make it pretty easy to change what each state does and adding new ones! also, `"idc"` in the state means that we should interpret it as "dont change, this state doesnt care about what was happening"! not sure if this will come useful, but whatever!

ok, 6:51 PM, off to dinner! in the meantime, here's a commit!
