# 8/23/2025 - 17th Update!

5:00 PM sharp, back on the project! elevator work! ok, figured out the rotation issue, turns out the drivetrain was rotated this entire time. this fix seems to have broken a couple things... oops

and now, the ground intake is stuck on seemingly nothing once again.

looked at past logs, dont seem to be able to find whats causing this? ok, so the issue was funny rotations again, just pulled everythng out of the "shell" and rotated the shell (all angles to 0 degrees), and put everything back in, and godot does some magic or something and realizes that the same thing works

in theory, rotation issues *should* be fixed, did that process to everything

ok yeah, gotta disable gravity on the elevator, or ill have to write feedforward and do sysid on it, which i kinda dont feel like doing. or do i? as in, disable gravity, i definitely dont want to write that? seems like probably not, we could probably account for it with tuning

we might need to do some feedforward work, since our current constants are using p to compensate for gravity, which causes it to kinda overshoot a lot, but it "works"!

i know all the programmers (including myself) would be very appalled if they looked at the shenanigans going on here, so keep in mind i will put a mental note to work on it. also, anyone reading the code, two pid controllers for individual bits of the elevator should not be done (doesnt make sense mechanically either). hmm, maybe it does... anywho, lets not do that.

yep, seems that before i messed up the whole shell and rotating thing, just did it again (since, the arm was spinning the wrong axis)

and now they're moving together! i should probably add a gif here to scare any programmers watching this

ok, 6:40 PM, going to eat dinner! oh, and here's a commit!
