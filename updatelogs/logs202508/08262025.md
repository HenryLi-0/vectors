# 8/26/2025 - 20th Update!

ok, so this doesn't mean that we're *done*, but today's the last day for the `portal-vr` YSWS! meaning, we have to submit by 11:59 PM today! also know as, we have to kinda add the "VR" aspect to this project, since we currently have one screen and what not. additionally, its kinda hard to attach an XBOX controller to a phone display, since... well... yeah. however, lets not think about that, and just find out how to implement vr into a godot project! should be fairly simple... right?

referencing [the YSWS website](https://portalvr.hackclub.com/), found [this](https://developers.meta.com/horizon/blog/getting-started-with-the-open-source-game-engine-godot/) meta article for doing VR in godot!

why does searching in the asset library crash godot. seems like it doesn't exist anymore? huh, i think i remember finding soemthing about godot and XR when searching for cameras in godot?

ok, so found [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gbTUNg99lrg) neat video on setting up the XR stuff, and its working! obviously, i dont have a headset or whatever, but it does load! also, yes, this means you need to install the addon yourself, since i dont want this repository to be huge

ok, did a bit more searching, found yet [another video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=znT4R-qSawg) about setting up meta vr simulator! ok, been a bit, and ive realized that this does a VERY painful amount of lag

hmm, now that im trying it again, its not working? like the simulator doesnt open?

ok, so individual scenes are working properly, but loading the main one just doesnt work. huh.

left at 6:34 PM for dinner and back at 7 PM! i cant figure this out. quick commit before i start taking stuff apart to figure out the issue!
