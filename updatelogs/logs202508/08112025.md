# 8/11/2025 - 6th Update!

ok, 8:20 PM now, just got back from playing with collision and stuff in godot, so it seems like we can add spinny things! ok, now, time to get back to modeling! also just came back from watching the mosim second new robot in the next update stream! ok, time to model

ok, just gonna redo the entire ground intake thing since it was goofy as heck!

ok, its 8:44 PM, and sketched the right side!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202508/08112025 - 1.png>)

yeah, kinda messy, but its for accuracy!

ok, left side done!

ok, so gotta work on the gearbox and the front thingy. for now, just gonna commit, then start cleaning up godot and preparing!

just set up a code skeleton! nothing much, just a bunch of files to make and write! ok, back to cad!

actually this ground intake is quite terrifying to recreate, i think im gonna go model the field now actually!

[here's](https://cad.onshape.com/documents/14c6855735b6d6a330a968b5/w/6a4f8aad4ba9e1144d545a32/e/6108cee1cf837762e5424864) a link to the actual one! on second thought, its probably smarter to just export the entire field and use blender or something to reduce the triangles!

hmm. thats a big file.

whys it still growing... 48 MB, not that bad, but maybe could be better? gotta see what "coarse resolution" means... 3d viewer has given up, i guess try blender? wait i forgot to hide some coral oops

wait, need to figure out whats stealing all my storage, why am i rapidly losing storage

so uh, blender crashed. three times. i guess a 48 MB field is *alright*? hmm gonna try another compression technique? huh 40 MB, guess thats alright! ok, turns out godot hates the compressed version, so nvm

so it appears that godot meshes dont exactly support gtlf itself, so gotta import this in? oh it just crashed


turns out the strategy was to export it as a .glb file, which also nicely compacts it! (14.2 MB) unforunately it seems to have lost the transparency data so lemme try to fix that

![waw](</updatelogs/images/202508/08112025 - 2.png>)

ok, fixed it up in blender, exporting!

looks good! wait, i got a funny idea

ok, after laughing a bit too much at a bunch of robots colliding with each other, i think godot's physics engine can handle this! ok, gonna add the field wall collisions

![woo](</updatelogs/images/202508/08112025 - 3.png>)

so yeah, thats it for tonight! probably gonna try to model more tomorrow! ok, good night!
