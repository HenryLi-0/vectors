# 8/25/2025 - 19th Update!

future henry's here now, currently 6:21 PM ~~hey its the funny number~~ in NYC, and trying to figure out how to make this arm intake work! while we're here, i think it'll be neat to make the camera follow the robot for now, just for testing! oh wait, we already did that...

hmm the rollers sometimes just spontanteously stop, think its a physics issue, but trying to figure out how to make ground intaking easier, as it is incredibly hard right now...

oh its because i didnt connect the signal. ok.

huh still not working?

oh, it is, its just not controlling it or something? oh, its because its when the body enters, not if it is entered (so its already entered when the program begins so it doesnt trigger)? never mind, that still doesnt fix it. ah, it only works on the one coral we have because we were testing if it's name was `Coral`, and theres only one `Coral`. ah.

ok, arm issue should be fixed now! gonna go eat dinner, its currently 6:59 PM! here's a commit too!
