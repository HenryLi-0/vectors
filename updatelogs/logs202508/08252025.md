# 8/25/2025 - 19th Update!

future henry's here now, currently 6:21 PM ~~hey its the funny number~~ in NYC, and trying to figure out how to make this arm intake work! while we're here, i think it'll be neat to make the camera follow the robot for now, just for testing! oh wait, we already did that...

hmm the rollers sometimes just spontanteously stop, think its a physics issue, but trying to figure out how to make ground intaking easier, as it is incredibly hard right now...

oh its because i didnt connect the signal. ok.

huh still not working?

oh, it is, its just not controlling it or something? oh, its because its when the body enters, not if it is entered (so its already entered when the program begins so it doesnt trigger)? never mind, that still doesnt fix it. ah, it only works on the one coral we have because we were testing if it's name was `Coral`, and theres only one `Coral`. ah.

ok, arm issue should be fixed now! gonna go eat dinner, its currently 6:59 PM! here's a commit too! also, note to future me, we gotta add enabling and disabling the detection areas from automatically grabbing coral

ok, 10:00 PM, time to focus, today's theoretically our last day for this, since we gotta submit by midnight tomorrow. that means, we need to get intaking and scoring *at least* working!

ok, currently just adding janky code to make it "snap" into place, since ground intaking is a pain already, the non-existent coral intake alignment system makes that way harder (the phycsics engine got confused last time), so yeah, just making the intaking areas snap the coral to the proper position!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202508/08252025 - 1.png>)

yeah, idk how that happened. ok, got to find a way to get the transfer working, but turns out part of the code was a really weird way of doing things, and now that its supposed to work it doesnt. also, currently adjusting the hitbox size for the arm detector!

ah, ok, i see the issue now! once again, its the fact that `_on_body_entered` runs when something ENTERS, not if something ALREADY entered! ok, the solution i guess is to just increase the pretransfer elevator height!

ok, nice! the logic's working properly now! there was just another issue that trasnfering it between subsystems (ground intake -> arm) made the ground intake still think it had a coral, meaning, even after the arm took it, the ground intake is able to tell the coral to release itself, which has now been fixed!

10 minute break later, starting work on the hitboxes for the reef! oh right, here's a quite commit!
