# 8/19/2025 - 13th Update!

8:32 PM, once again a cool night in nyc, how you doing?

hopefully good! working on it once again! we are, turns out, actually mostly on schedule! "subsystems should move" works as of yesterday, so thats neat! now just work on actually making the physics stuff work of course.

ok, fixed the issue of the ground intake not going down! turns out it was some weird stuff with the model, but thats now good! time to start figuring out how to make it do what its job suggests (intaking)

so it seems like the ground intake rollers (the top ones) just get stuck. huh. (swapped them out for rectangular prisms, hopefully should allow better intaking?) seems to be a problem for all rollers, so im suspecting its something wrong with the code itself?

oh guess what turns out the rotation lock is preventing cursed code from running. the problem? the cursed code used to run normally. i guess we gotta go back in git now...

so, same exact code, doesnt seem to work. gonna commit now, then do some time traveling!
