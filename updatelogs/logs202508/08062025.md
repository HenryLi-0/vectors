# 8/6/2025 - 2nd Update!

ok, so today was actually a huge day! finally started learning stuff about godot, and it seems pretty cool! [here's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LOhfqjmasi0) the tutorial i used (its 2D, but thats pretty good for basics i guess). gonna try to watch a gdscript tutorial (syntax looks very similar to javascript and python), so yeah, probably gonna be ok?

also planning on doing the 3d tutorial tomorrow, but yeah, pretty big day today, made my first godot game! this took like 3 hours (mainly because i was playing around with experimenting with stuff during the tutorial), but didnt exactly feel like this should be counted in the timer (since, its kinda learning. i know it technically does count, but i also forgor to install the godot hackatime lol)
