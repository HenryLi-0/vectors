# 8/21/2025 - 15th Update!

ok, gonna play around with the geometry of the intake! currently 5:08 PM, and its still pretty cool in NYC!

hmm slowing down the intake did not help, also just realized its been a while since a devlog on the summer of making site, so imma get a gif real quick

my computer is not liking this

yes, i realize the rollers arent spinning, i guess thats lag?

hmm so the robot doesnt actually move, as in the object, itself, but the drivetrain moves. hopefully that isnt an issue? i guess ill just have a little script that exposes the location and stuff to stuff outside?

still dont get why coral keeps clipping into the ground? turns out the robot is fully capable of driving over coral, gonna check these collision boxes again...

gonna try increasing the roller size, currently a box of `0.05`...

why are the rollers stopping themselves.

played around with collision layers and stuff, in theory, the rollers shouldnt collide with the floor anymore, so thats good, and coral seems to actually move with the rollers, which is also good, but its not going "up"

ok, i have an idea! been tuning the rotation of the ground intake (yes, very cursed, but it goes funny when we drive it into the ground), but we need to have like a "shield" for it to not fly out while its in the intake or go in the wrong way. additionally, if it doesnt work by the end of today, its probably just smarter to just put a jank solution of teleporting it in (again, last resort, but yeah)

ok, quick commit

yep, nothing else, going to bed, oops, i think we're really behind schedule! anyways, good night!
