# 8/10/2025 - 5th Update!

ok, so just added the license! also, last night, just added the onshape wakatime extension, so that stuff should also be logged! ok, back to CAD! also, yeah, last night i also added the elevator bits

oh thats 3 inches not 2...

![yay](</updatelogs/images/202508/08102025 - 1.png>)

started work on adding fancier apperances! not sure we can export with color, but in theory, yes?

huh did something funny and a certain measurement shifted by `0.000135` inches? strangely round number?

ok, its been a bit, added bumpers, fixed various stuff, added elevator base top support and bottom brackets (no diagonal ones yet), and was starting the arm when i remembered we shouldnt use too many circles

you know what, im gonna do the ground intake first!

wait i just got really disoriented in onshape and noticed something. is left and right switched? since if that's the front, should that be the left and that the right? huh?

im getting really, really tired from all this CADing (simplifying this ground intake is really, really hard), here's just a commit for now

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202508/08102025 - 2.png>)

gonna test import it into godot again!

hmm it seems to have lost a couple surfaces and some are now one way visible? idk, here's a commit!
