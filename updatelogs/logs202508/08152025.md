# 8/15/2025 - 10th Update!

welcome back! currently 5:38 PM on a rather warm day up here in NYC! ok, we're here and back again, currently listening to the xrc sim theme music on that one music app, and just got super excited lol. anyways, since this is an update log, i can technically put whatever i want to make you read here so yeah, there you go. also unrelated, im assuming if you're reading this you *really* want something interesting to do? well, go check out the housepets comic by rick griffin studios! 75 pages in and its already a super fun and funny read (started yesterday night!)! anyways, back to code!

back in godot, time to make collision boxes! ok, stage 1 box tubing is done, working on the arm now, i guess ill try to keep this very simple?

ok, added, and THE WHEELS SPIN NOW!!! well, only the arm wheels, since i just remembered we forgot to model the swerve wheels. hmm the entire arm rotates around the center in the code while in the model it rotates properly. very weird...

hmm so modifying the rotation directly allows it to rotate around the place its supposed to, but i think ive found another issue

![huh](</updatelogs/images/202508/08152025 - 1.png>)

thats not supposed to happen... the stuff is currently axis locked, so i have no clue how this happens? maybe its because of direct rotation modifying, let me play around with doing it properly again...

the solution was the center of gravity! again! turns out godot uses the center of mass (under mass distribution, defaults to automatically calculated) to do the torque thing! used a custom value at the model origin and its rotating!

just realized we should probably set the mass of each part other than the drive train to 0 for now, since i dont want to do sysid for this

seems to be moving fine, added some sus code to simulate wheels slowing down, just concerned about the fact that the wheels still keep popping out

hmm is it possible that collision lock is world based not object based? not sure about it, but testing suggests it since it seems to want to "cave in" on the plate when they arent moving together (as in, the arm is at an angle and the wheels are told to spin)

ok, its 7:05 PM, a bit tired (i foresee a lot of weird vector math), but yeah, still need to add that ground intake general collision box!

its 10:04 PM and i just read 20 more pages, wow this is a really nice read so far. anyways, i have a thought. what if we just dont rotation lock the other axis and hope godot does the applied torque from the object perspective

yeah, i guess that didnt work. basically, it seems that its not from the object's perspective, but we did have to unlock the other axis anyways.

uh somehow got them to line up in the wrong direction?

after chatting with omniscient beings, it finally works!

ok, i am very tired and confused now, but i think i see a plan forming. obviously, we are falling behind schedule (the robot, in fact, is NOT moving), but basically, the robot subsystems (as in, the stack of stuff), are basically controlling themselves and all part of the top command thing, so that basically can go `arm.goal()` and the arm moves itself, and deals with the feedforward and feedback and what not. idk how i feel about adding PID control. 

ok, back after laying on bed for a couple minutes, gonna commit and then see how far we can get with this!

oh right, and ground intake collision box

files set up now, let's get going!

*im tired boss*

hmm its that problem again with drivetrain that it doesnt want to move, then you multiply the force a ton, then it flies off

ok, super buggy code, doesnt rotate in place (rotates but like not at the origin?), moves kinda wonky, and everything isnt in prespective with each other (why cant it just default to the object's perspective, not the world perspective), so the arm does funny stuff when at certain robot rotations. also, you can fly out of the field sometimes if you go into the glass fast enough.

yeah, 12:30 AM, really tired today for some reason, good night!
