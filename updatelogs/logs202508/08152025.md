# 8/15/2025 - 10th Update!

welcome back! currently 5:38 PM on a rather warm day up here in NYC! ok, we're here and back again, currently listening to the xrc sim theme music on that one music app, and just got super excited lol. anyways, since this is an update log, i can technically put whatever i want to make you read here so yeah, there you go. also unrelated, im assuming if you're reading this you *really* want something interesting to do? well, go check out the housepets comic by rick griffin studios! 75 pages in and its already a super fun and funny read (started yesterday night!)! anyways, back to code!

back in godot, time to make collision boxes! ok, stage 1 box tubing is done, working on the arm now, i guess ill try to keep this very simple?

ok, added, and THE WHEELS SPIN NOW!!! well, only the arm wheels, since i just remembered we forgot to model the swerve wheels. hmm the entire arm rotates around the center in the code while in the model it rotates properly. very weird...

hmm so modifying the rotation directly allows it to rotate around the place its supposed to, but i think ive found another issue

![huh](</updatelogs/images/202508/08152025 - 1.png>)

thats not supposed to happen... the stuff is currently axis locked, so i have no clue how this happens? maybe its because of direct rotation modifying, let me play around with doing it properly again...

the solution was the center of gravity! again! turns out godot uses the center of mass (under mass distribution, defaults to automatically calculated) to do the torque thing! used a custom value at the model origin and its rotating!

just realized we should probably set the mass of each part other than the drive train to 0 for now, since i dont want to do sysid for this

seems to be moving fine, added some sus code to simulate wheels slowing down, just concerned about the fact that the wheels still keep popping out

hmm is it possible that collision lock is world based not object based? not sure about it, but testing suggests it since it seems to want to "cave in" on the plate when they arent moving together (as in, the arm is at an angle and the wheels are told to spin)

ok, its 7:05 PM, a bit tired (i foresee a lot of weird vector math), but yeah, still need to add that ground intake general collision box!
