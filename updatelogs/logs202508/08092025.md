# 8/8/2025 - 4th Update!

alright, so ive been thinking. its 6:05 PM on saturday (no way) and ive got some ideas. so, ive decided that, since we appear to be making a clone of this particular robot in school already, the first robot to be implemented wil be... a 1778 clone (i love their robot this year too so theres that). i considered 2910 (worlds champions, can be modelled really easily), 1690 (worlds champions last year, semi champions this year, and i just like a lot of their robots), and 1155 (my team! unfortunately this year was kinda womp womp), but 1778 eventually was my pick since i really like the architecture, can also be relatively simply to model, and we're making a clone of it already (main point), so why not make a simulator for actual practice?

so yeah, let's do a 1778! godot *should* (in theory) be able to handle all the logic for physics (might play around with collision boxes in the future), but first, before any of that, let's consider our node structure! godot appears to love nodes and scenes, so lets design one carefully! also, today's gonna also be a modelling day

- Main (Node3D)
    - Environment (WorldEnvironment)
    - Lighting
        - Sunlight (DirectionalLight)(main lights)
        - Spotlights (DirectionalLight) (if feeling fancy)
    - Field (Node3D)
        - Field Model (Mesh) (+ low quality mesh)
        - Field Collision (Static Body)
        - GamePieces (Node3D) (needs to also control summoning logic)
            - Coral + Algae
    - Player (xr origin)
        - camera
        - controller???
    - Robot (instance of Robot.tscn)
    - Other Robots (Node3D)
        - Silly Robot 1 (instance of Robot.tscn)
        - etc.
    - Venue (Node3D)
        - Field Spectation (Node3D)
            - Bleachers
                - Model, Collsion
            - TV
                - Image x4
        - Pit Area (Node3D)
            - todo
    - Audio (Node3D)
        - Anouncer (Audio Stream Player)
        - Crowd (Audio Stream Player)
        - Match Audio (Audio Stream Player)
    - UI
        - Timer Display
        - Mode Display
        - Controller hints?

all robots implement a robot object, so they all get inputs of the xbox/keyboard controller (ex. all of them get told when x is pressed, but each robot decides what x does), this should allow for implementing future robots

- 1778Robot (rigid body)
    - drive (node3d)
        - chassis (mesh) (main body mesh AND modules, no wheels though)
        - chassis colision (collision)
        - swervemodules (node3d)
            - swerve_fl
                - wheel (mesh) (realistically only thing needed)
            - etc.
    - outtake (node3d)
        - elevator stage 1
            - etc.
        - elevator stage 2
            - etc.
        - arm (node3d)
            - arm segment
            - wheels
            - wheels
    - intake (node3d)
        - main body
        - wheels
        - wheels
    - extra details

ok, i just confused myself for a second, but yeah, its 6:30 PM, that was quite some writing! imma head off to dinner real quick.

back from dinner and watching the mosim v25.1 reveal stream! its 8:34 PM, and time to start working on the 1778 simplified model...

ok, so started the stream, you should see me typing this right now, but yeah, CAD time! ok, 9:06 PM, gonna brb

back at 9:44 PM! so like 5 motorcycles passed by outside my house, which is really funny since every time i stream something on youtube, they always come by. which is so strange? gonna start testing stuff in godot, just installed the [hackatime](https://hackatime.hackclub.com/docs/editors/godot)!

so it appears my internet blew up? but, on the plus side, we got a robot falling!

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202508/08092025 - 1.png>)

ok, boxed the robot in with a couple walls, but it seems to be getting stuck on them, as if the walls have super high friction. this usually isnt the case in actual frc, since the walls are made of polycarbonate? (or whatever that fancy material they use is) 

so yeah, i guess im gonna keep modelling tomorrow, 11:38 PM, theres a bug in my room and yeah, good night!

wait after playing mosim for a second, i guess you can get stuck on the walls? might make sense since square bumpers and swerve motors all pointing in that direction, now that i think about it? gonna test it on xrc...

ok, that's it for today! good night!
