# 8/7/2025 - 3rd Update!

ok, so today it turns out we got a week extension and its now due august 23, so we have lots of time! its 8:53 PM right now, and as im working on 3d printing parts for [raven](https://github.com/HenryLi-0/raven/), im gonna watch [a tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1zJS31tr88) on gdscript! this isnt going in the time counting by the way, im just watching the video and just writing an update here!

ok, its now 10:07 PM (again, this isnt meant to be a hackatime replacement thing, just saying its an update), and just finished the video! something i took away was that its basically funny python, really similar to it, but just with a couple interesting things with classes and enums. but yeah! i think its about time we watch the 3D tutorial!

10:12 PM and started watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ke5KpqcoiIU) video on godot for 3D!

ok, so i decided to try to write my own controller. uh things occur.

ok so its 11:05 PM and maybe i shouldve just used the add on or something since the character does not move with you, and the player kinda renders in front of the scene. im actually gonna go watch a movie now, so that was interesting?

![huh](</updatelogs/images/202508/08072025 - 1.png>)

so uh that players behind the wall. and thats also you. so i have no clue! yeah, might be a moment to take a step away for a bit!

hmm seem to have fixed it?

yeah so 3d seems to be a pretty big leap from 2d. i might just watch the rest of the tutorial since this is way too much stuff, and its probably more time efficient to practice on the fly later. ive noticed that godot is really similar to the idea of like stacked stuff in FRC design (like the website course thing), where we have assemblies in assemblies, similarly to how godot has scenes in scenes. also, note for future self, consider changing physics engine to jolt (idk video suggested it)

ok, its 12:44 AM now, gonna head off to bed, gonna maybe start modelling a robot tomorrow!
