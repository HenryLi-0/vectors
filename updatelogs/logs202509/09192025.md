# 9/19/2025 - 25th Update!

go go go

so, auto aligning! gonna update some of the driving code so that we fix yesterday's bug, along with being able to control it through a pid controller!

hmm cant seem to be able to figure out how to fix the sideways moving bug, guess ill work on that later.

ok, its working! not sure why the Z translation is inverted, but i guess itll do for now!

ok, its actually tracking to its position now! error is roughly 2 cm as of now, so thats pretty good (from testing its usually roughly 2 or 3 cm, with uncommon levels of 1 or 4 cm)! also fixed a couple of driving issues where rotation wasnt being capped or multiplied by delta, and fixed some cursed translation normalizing

now, to get translating to the correct target spot working... ok, so the second after i say this, something breaks, since now its driving in an orbit (1690 reference???) around the reef.

huh, as i suspected, we had the order of the controllers reversed, it actually goes ZX instead of XZ, probably because of some input thing

OH OH OH (we're very close)

ok, so it did happen once, but the coral kinda slid down the pole, so we should probably make sure it can't do that. anyways, can't seem to be able to get the coral to stay perfectly on L4, but here's one of it almost being on!

![yay](</updatelogs/images/202509/09192025 - 1.png>)

ok, i havent tried L3 yet, maybe that'll work? nope, i guess we have to tune these angles, since we don't actually need all that "force" to "slam" the coral on as in real life, we probably dont need such wide angles for scoring (this is also due to the reason that we stop forcing the coral position when we are tracking to the "score" state!)

ok, that's it for today! we could shift stuff in the schedule a bit back because i forgot we had two days off next week (imo, just give us the whole week off at that point lol, 2 days off in the middle of the week is kinda weird), so yeah! its 1:04 AM now in NYC, so good night!
