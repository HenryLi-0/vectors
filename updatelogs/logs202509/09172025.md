# 9/17/2025 - 23rd Update!

ok, its 12:15 AM, lets get going!

been searching for quite a while, but how are we supposed to make the walls of the coral? theres gotta be a way to make the collision box thats better than 12 rectangular prisms?

so yeah, i added 16 rectangular prisms, which ironically was faster that finding a way to make this faster. anyways,

coral goes in! still playing around with dimensions and stuff, but its working!

ok, i dont seem to be able to make the robot do it just yet, but that's fine, we could get that working later! ok, thats it for today, quite simple, since its 1 AM now! ok, good night!
