# 9/16/2025 - 22nd Update!

so. its been like two weeks since the last update. simply, school is not exactly nice to working on coding projects (especially since frc is starting up again so im gonna have to manage homework and stuff better!)

anyways, this has given me a lot of time to think of what i want `vectors` to become. basically, i thought of how to do the VR thing myself, no need for the YSWS. here's the idea! if you look at [this](https://harrylee-0.github.io/phoneOdometry/) page on a phone, then enable the odometry and stuff, you can get the axis rotation measurements of your phone (well, i only tested this on an iPhone)! the idea is, we can stream a video over to the phone, while also grabbing the rotation measurements. downside is the obvious bottleneck, after computation power, is router speed. not sure if we could have a wired setup, but the lag would be probably less than a quarter of a second at worse?

anyways, back to godot! lets finish this thing! (11:30 PM on a very math-related date! (its also funny i turned $4^2=16$ years old today lol))

also yeah, i finished reading housepets on 9/4/2025 night! awesome read! currently reading it again, but this time 5 comics per day instead of 100. ok, back to godot!

ok, so it seems like i somehow fixed the elevator self detachment issue when the arm is pointing down? all i did was angle the arm to start at -45 degrees, so i guess that fixed it? ok, now to work on scoring!

yay! the reef is detecting it! although, we aren't exactly "dropping it in". ok, gonna quickly add a bunch of branches so that we can start testing stuff!

just kidding, i actually worked on adding split screen! this is gonna be eventually how we implement vr, but im using this currently for another view point!

arm detached once, not really sure whats causing it!

also, since today (well, its not exactly 9/16 anymore when im typing this, but lets just say it is 9/16) is my birthday, im feeling like adding some pressure for myself to actually start working on this! and also since im feeling pretty good right now! how? oh, this repository's going public! even though we're not done yet!

ok, that's it (its 12:50 AM), good night!
