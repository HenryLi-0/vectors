# 9/1/2025 - 21st Update!

oh wow almost a week passed since the last update...

how you all doing? well, this repository isnt even public so youre probably ok? hopefully? thats good. basically, i found some fun free time, so im gonna start kicking up work on this again! hopefully that break let me refill my creativity (well, thats been going to my art lately), but yeah! time to start things up again! (totally not because im procrastinating school stuff)

currently 10:35 right now! also, ive realized that this update log also tracks my progress in reading housepets, so im at comic 1761 as of right now! anyways, back to godot!

seems like i didnt clean up the xr tools stuff fully...

wow i so want to rewrite and redo everything, but lets not do that just yet, lets just finish this out, make it look better, then think about where we go from there.

so i changed the field from a rigidbody3d to a staticbody3d, and the robot decides to explode itself

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202509/09012025 - 1.png>)

so yeah that happened. shouldnt happen, so currently investigating. quick commit in case i break something!
