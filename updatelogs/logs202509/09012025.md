# 9/1/2025 - 21st Update!

oh wow almost a week passed since the last update...

how you all doing? well, this repository isnt even public so youre probably ok? hopefully? thats good. basically, i found some fun free time, so im gonna start kicking up work on this again! hopefully that break let me refill my creativity (well, thats been going to my art lately), but yeah! time to start things up again! (totally not because im procrastinating school stuff)

currently 10:35 right now! also, ive realized that this update log also tracks my progress in reading housepets, so im at comic 1761 as of right now! anyways, back to godot!

seems like i didnt clean up the xr tools stuff fully...

wow i so want to rewrite and redo everything, but lets not do that just yet, lets just finish this out, make it look better, then think about where we go from there.

so i changed the field from a rigidbody3d to a staticbody3d, and the robot decides to explode itself

![hmm](</updatelogs/images/202509/09012025 - 1.png>)

so yeah that happened. shouldnt happen, so currently investigating. quick commit in case i break something!

so the solution appears that using joints was the solution from the beginning.

ok, neat! so, basically used the generic6dofjoint3d and used that to constrain the robot axis, and it seems to work! only issue is, the rollers (which all use pinjoint3d) are currently very confused. this, however, seems to be able to be solved by using the joints on both sides of the rollers, which actually kinda makes sense if you think about it. (as in, it shouldve been obvious to me a lot sooner lol) (we could probably use a 6dof joint here too, but whatever)

and there it goes! nice! ok, time to fix the code now...

ok, references updated, now some rotation stuff is broken (arm and ground intake, and something seems locked). oh right, one more thing, had to unlock everything from linear/angular locking! ok, so something wasnt locked with the physics body thing, it was locked through code! we dont need to force lock the arm and ground intake rotation through code now! yay! but pid is still really broken.

oh i know why this is happening. gonna turn off gravity! ok, that seems to have fixed some thing?

ok, small issue, the elevator stuff keeps popping out of their joints. probably just gonna add more. also, made the rotation of the arm and ground intake forced rotation, since i dont wanna do feedforward right now! also, another issue, we are driving so fast we get a moment of airtime (as in, part of the robot is lifted off the ground), so thats funny

ok, so it seems that low cog is also important here!

![uhh](</updatelogs/images/202509/09012025 - 2.png>)

ok, cant seem to fix the fact that the arm keeps getting possessed occasionally, but nice progress today! ok, 12:41 AM now, good night!
